Castling is a move that can be performed by a King and one of the two Rooks,
given that neither the chosen Rook nor the King have moved since the start
of the game. Castling is either queenside, where the King moves a distance of
three squares to the left, or kingside, where the King moves a distance of three
squares to the right. The move is completed by the Rook then jumping over
the King, landing adjacent to the King. Castling may only be done if the King
has never moved, the Rook involved has never moved, the squares between the
King and the Rook involved are unoccupied, the King is not in check, and the
King does not cross over or end on a square in check. Figure 2 illustrates the
castling opportunities
